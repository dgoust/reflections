How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?


it is agood idea to have versions of your document for some reasone 
1- if you have a mistake you can notece it easly 
2-if work seem different and the last one not satisfy you you can back to any version 
3- if you lost last file thats not aproblem because there is other version of it and mybe there is a backup of it itself


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
1-safe time for looking about the file
2-make me sure this is the the version i want to back to if it have it's day
  



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

advanteges of commit manualy is :
1 - you save version of file when you need or when you make important change
2 - easy to read and understand difference between versions 

disadvanteges of commit automaticly is:
1- commit things you don't need to commit
2- maybe differences gets biger than to read and understand 
3- may be differences commit gets smaller then you will have many many files with minor changes and this would be a lot


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

--because these files maybe related to each other and affect in one another.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
i don't panic any time crisis happend because i always have old version to back to.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
want get for my develop work
