What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
creat git repository to track changes in my files


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area allow us keep files we will commit in it untill finish our work wile repository save commits 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

compare staging area with working directory by git diff to see modifying files then compare stagin area with most recent commit 
if all looking wright then commit changes.
